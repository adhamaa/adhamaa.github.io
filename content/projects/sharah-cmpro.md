name: Sharah CMpro
order: 2
draft: false
kicker: Accounting platform with HR built in — an independent product of mine
problem: A small manufacturer was running finance and people on separate tools, so the same employee, the same month and the same ringgit had to be entered twice — and reconciled by hand whenever the two disagreed.
build: "One admin console where production, payroll and the ledger share a single database and permission model: cash in/out, revenue and profit, trial balance, balance sheet, fixed assets and Tax & Zakat on the accounting side; employees, attendance, payroll and owner drawings on the people side. I designed the schema, wrote the API, built every screen, and shipped it to the edge."
role: Solo — schema, API, UI, deploy
year: 2026 — present
stack:
  - Vite
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - Hono
  - Cloudflare
  - Neon Postgres
highlights:
  - Real double-entry bookkeeping — trial balance and balance sheet are derived from the same entries staff record daily, not re-keyed
  - Tax & Zakat handled as first-class modules, because a Malaysian SME needs both and generic accounting tools give you neither
  - Multi-user with per-entry attribution, so every transaction traces back to whoever recorded it
  - Serverless Postgres on Neon behind a Hono API on Cloudflare Workers — no servers to patch, cold starts in milliseconds
